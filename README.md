This skin is to be considered pre-alpa, basically you don't want to be using it
unless you're a developer interested in contributing to it.

This skin is intended to replace 90% of the base CSS in Komodo with something
very bare basic and simple, that can then be extended upon.

# What's working

 * The general tone of the skin is there
 
# What isn't working

 * Everything else
 
# Contributing

Please note that though the project is in its early stages and therefore the code
is not as clean as it ought to be, any contributions should strive to be as clean
and tidy as possible given the current structure of the project. I'll gladly
review PR's that strive to organize the codebase, I'm waiting for the project
to take shape before I do that myself.

# Building
